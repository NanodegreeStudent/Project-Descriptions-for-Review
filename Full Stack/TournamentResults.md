Students will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. Students will then write a Python module to rank the players and pair them up in matches in a tournament.

## How will students complete this project?

1. Install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. Clone the [fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository](http://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)
3. Launch the Vagrant VM
4. Write SQL database and table definitions in a file (`tournament.sql`)
5. Write Python functions filling out a template of an API (`tournament.py`)
6. Run a test suite to verify your code (`tournament_test.py`)
