## Project Overview

You will get acquainted with your text editor, creating and editing simple HTML and CSS files to create your very first webpage!

## Why this Project?

Every site you visit is, at its core, just a collection of text files that your browser can read and display. Being able to work efficiently within a text editor to create and edit these text files is a critical skill all aspiring web developers must master. 

Additionally, this project will familiarize you with project submission and reviewing feedback you receive from your evaluator.

## What will I learn?

You will learn how to create and edit text files within your text editor, basic HTML to display a web page, and how to properly establish relative links between files.

## Why is this important to my career?

* As a Front-End Web Developer, your text editor is the most important tool in your toolbox.
* Using your text editor efficiently to create and edit files is the most basic and frequently accomplished task day to day.
* Properly understanding how directory/folder structures work and how to relatively link files are key to maintaining a well organized application.

## How do I Complete this Project?

1. Download a quality text editor designed for developers. We recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) or [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
2. Create a new directory on your computer to hold the work for this project.
3. Create an `index.html` file within this directory.
4. Within `index.html` - write valid HTML containing the proper `DOCTYPE`, `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags.
5. Within your page's `body`, add a paragraph that includes the phrase, "Hello World!"
6. Create a new directory, within your project directory, called `css`.
7. Create a new file, within the `css` directory, named `style.css`.
8. Properly link this CSS file from within your `index.html`.
9. Open your `index.html` file in your browser and review the results.
10. Within your CSS, change the color of all text on the page using `body { color: red; }`
11. Refresh the `index.html` file in your browser and review how your changes have altered the page.
